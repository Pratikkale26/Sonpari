# 🌟 Sonpari

**Sonpari** is a social gold savings app that helps families and friends save small amounts of gold daily, build saving streaks, and gift gold on birthdays, festivals, and special occasions.

Gold is deeply emotional — Sonpari makes it **habit-forming and accessible**.

---

## ✨ Why Sonpari?

Gold is traditionally gifted during festivals, weddings, and milestones.  
But buying gold all at once can be financially difficult, and offline stores make it impractical to buy very small amounts frequently.

Sonpari solves this by:
- Enabling **micro-saving in gold**
- Encouraging **daily or weekly saving habits**
- Making gold **easy to gift digitally**
- Removing the friction of offline gold purchases

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Create a Group**  
   Form family or friend groups to save together.

2. **Save Gold Regularly**  
   Save small amounts of gold daily or weekly.

3. **Build Streaks**  
   Streaks encourage consistency and habit formation.

4. **Gift Gold**  
   Gift accumulated gold on birthdays, festivals, or special occasions.
